HPE Sphinx
==============

The HPE Sphinx itâ€™s a fork from the picoCTF Platform 2. The platform is designed to 
be easily adapted to other CTF or programming competitions. The main goal of this 
fork is to provide a generic platform to create generic programming challenges.

The main changes from the original consists on:
- Remove Students/Teacher Roles
- Remove dynamic creation of teams
- Remove shell and chat tabs
- Add multiline response to problems


HPE Sphinx targets Ubuntu 14.04 LTS but should work on just about 
any "standard" Linux distribution. It would probably even work on 
Windows. MongoDB must be installed; all default configurations should 
work.

Setting Up
------------
1. Download VirtualBox (easiest, though others can work)
2. Download Vagrant (vagrantup.com)
3. `vagrant up` inside the repo
4. Wait 20 minutes
5. `vagrant ssh` to connect to the VM
6. Run `devploy` to deploy the development version of the site
7. Go to port 8080 on the Host Machine
8. Remember to always use 127.0.0.1:8080 not localhost:8080

*Note*: The competition has two modes: competition active and competition inactive. In inactive mode, there are no problems and only registration is available. To change what mode the competition is in, edit api/api/config.py and change the competition dates such that the current date is either inside or outside the range of the competition dates.


Loading the Example Problems (In the vagrant VM)
------------
1. Run `cd ~/api`
2. Run `python3 api_manager.py -v problems load /vagrant/example_problems/ graders/ ../problem_static/`
3. Run `python3 api_manager.py autogen build 100`
4. Run `devploy`


Running the Regression Tests
----------------------------

The platform comes with a series of regression tests that should be run before any change is committed to the API.
To run the tests:

1. `vagrant ssh` into your virtual machine.
2. Run `devploy` to bring up an instance from your latest code.
3. To be able to import the API, `cd api` and run the tests with `./run_tests.sh`
 
All tests should pass with your changes.
